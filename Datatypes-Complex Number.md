# ðŸ§®  Ex-04-Datatypes-Complex Number Creation in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a python program to Add  two complex  numbers.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Set a variable `c1` to the result of the expression `12+3j`.
2. Set a variable `c2` to the result of the expression `4+5j`.
3. print `(c1+c2)`.

## ðŸ’» Program
```
c1=12+3j
c2=4+5j
print(c1+c2)
```
